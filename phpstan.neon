# Due to the php 7.0 compatibility, this project uses an old version of PHPStan, with the following restrictions:
# - PHPStan does not automatically use this config file, it must be specified with the -c option
# - the config file cannot be named phpstan.neon.dist
# - the paths must be specified manually in the command line
# - the level must be specified manually in the command line with the --level option
# - we can't use the level 6 rule because PHP 7.0 provides limited type hint support
# - the phpunit extension must be used to avoid some errors, this extension is not necessary with more recent versions

includes:
    - vendor/phpstan/phpstan-phpunit/extension.neon

parameters:
    level: 5
    paths:
